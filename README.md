Human Computer Interaction Terrestrial Globe

The HCI Terrestrial Globe was conceptualized by the search of a more intuitive and innovative way of controlling Google-Earth, using a 50,00 euro budget. Based on this premise, we came up with the idea of controlling Google-Earth simply by rotating an sphere, giving users the feeling of rotating Google-Earth globe with their own hands. To achieve this, we decided to use a low cost solution for acquiring the sphere's two axis movements, namely two mouse sensors placed in the measured axis, which can provide the distance moved on each direction.
