Interfacing MOUSE-ARDUINO
Tutorial http://www.martijnthe.nl/2009/07/interfacing-an-optical-mouse-sensor-to-your-arduino/

PROBLEM
Missing WProgram.h

SOLUTION
http://arduino.cc/playground/Code/Library#WProgram
#include <WProgram.h> //It is very important to remember this! 
note that if you are using Arduino 1.0 IDE, 
change "WProgram.h" to "Arduino.h"

Yeah, these were removed intentionally.  You can use Arduino.h instead.

We were able to run the COORDINATES and SPEED examples
